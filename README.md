# CI-ldapproxy
A nodejs based ldapproxy to the CI web services as a docker image.
For a deeper discussion on the general topic of why this may be needed and how it fits into your overal Consumer IAM, see the following blog series here:
https://community.ibm.com/community/user/security/blogs/martin-schmidt1/2019/07/12/modernizing-your-b2c-portal-security-ciam

## Setting up the cloud environment

Make sure you setup your CIC cloud tenant as described in the blog entry above, and have obtained the following information:

* tenant ui
* tenant id
* tenant secret
* tenant registry

## Download the code

Pull the code from this registry and place it on a system that has docker and nodejs installed.

## Configure the local environment

Modify the dev.js file to include the information collected from the cloud environment, and set the ldap proxy settings.

```
// Dev environment for PPSdemo
module.exports = {
    tenant: {
      ui: 'https://ppsdemo.ice.ibmcloud.com',
      id: 'xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxxx',
      secret: 'yyyyyyyyy',
      registry: 'zzzzzz-zzzzz-zzzzz-zzzzz-zzzzzz'
    },
    ldap: {
      port: 389,
      root: 'o=pps',
      type: 'uid='
    },
    cache: {
      ttl: 60
    },
    log: "log",
  };
  // log levels are log - trace - debug - info - warn - error
```

## Build the node environment

Use the following command to install the application locally for node.

```
npm install .
```

This will download and install all the dependencies locally in preperation for the docker build.

You can validate the install using the command, and should show this result:

```
npm test
> ci_ldap_proxy@0.0.2 test /Users/schmidtm/Desktop/work/CI_Demo/CIldapproxy
> node ./src/test.js

2019-09-18T10:53:38-0500 <info> test.js:21 (main) start test
2019-09-18T10:53:39-0500 <info> CIToken.js:32 (CIToken.init) CIToken.init() token is - [oEyCOmDKhJu7W2PkxqtZ8q1sHaeUVusQQwTEqOcl]
2019-09-18T10:53:39-0500 <info> test.js:31 (main) exit test
```

## Build the Docker image

Using the following command to build the docker image, and to list it.

```
docker build schmidtm/proxy .
```

Verify the image was built.

```
docker images
REPOSITORY            TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
schmidtm/proxy        latest              c2f5ff602a5d        24 hours ago        303MB
```

## Running the Docker image and testing the proxy

Use the following command to start the image, mapping the ldap port to the local system port.

```
docker run -p 389:389 -d schmidtm/proxy
```
Get the running container id
```
docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                  NAMES
c06733557187        schmidtm/proxy      "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   4 seconds ago       Up 3 seconds        0.0.0.0:389->389/tcp   angry_herschel
```
Connecting to the running image as needed with container id, this will open a shell
```
docker exec -it c06733557187 /bin/sh
```
Tailing the output of stdout and stderr from the host, using the container id
```
docker logs c06733557187 -f

> ci_ldap_proxy@0.0.2 start /opt/app
> node ./src/proxy.js

2019-09-18T15:59:39+0000 <info> proxy.js:141 (main) start
2019-09-18T15:59:39+0000 <debug> CIRequest.js:28 (CIRequest.init) CIRequest.init()
2019-09-18T15:59:39+0000 <debug> proxy.js:69 (runLDAPServer) entry
2019-09-18T15:59:39+0000 <info> proxy.js:147 (main) exit
9/18/2019, 3:59:39 PM : LDAP server listening at ldap://0.0.0.0:389
2019-09-18T15:59:40+0000 <info> CIToken.js:32 (CIToken.init) CIToken.init() token is - [Snj78FvSUU1wbBBL2nq3wTzNOLdEe1rRNgc8L0rA]
```
With this tail of the log running, open a second command line with access to an ldapsearch command and run an ldapsearch similar to this (based on your configuration).
```
ldapsearch -h localhost -p 389 -D "uid=schmidtm,o=pps" -w secret123 -b "uid=schmidtm,o=pps" uid=*
```
You should now see additional output shown in the above tail command.

To stop the docker container issue the following command with the container id
```
docker stop c06733557187
```
